        The overarching question we would like to ask is how the population of universities affects gentrification in the surrounding areas. <em>The Scope</em> and <em>The Huntington News</em> have both published articles in the past couple of years regarding the adverse affects that Northeastern University's expansion has seemed to have on its surrounding neighborhoods. Gentrification is a complex, multi-facted issue. We have decided to reduce the scope of our project to just the impact of Northeastern Univerity's population size to the surrounding neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two main indicators of change that we looked at in the areas surrounding Northeastern University is the neighborhoods median income and racial diversity in comparison to the University. We will be looking at data from 2010 since there is a plethora of data from that year due to the census.
